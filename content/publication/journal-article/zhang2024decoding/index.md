abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has emerged as the most prevalent and complex neurodegenerative disorder among the elderly population. However, the genetic comorbidity etiology for AD remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted pleiotropic analysis for 41 AD phenotypic comorbidities, identifying ten genetic comorbidities with 16 pleiotropy genes associated with AD. Through biological functional and network analysis, we elucidated the molecular and functional landscape of AD genetic comorbidities. Furthermore, leveraging the pleiotropic genes and reported biomarkers for AD genetic comorbidities, we identified 50 potential biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Our findings deepen the understanding of the occurrence of AD genetic comorbidities and provide new insights for the search for AD diagnostic markers.

summary: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with poorly understood genetic comorbidities. This study identified ten genetic comorbidities and 16 pleiotropic genes linked to AD, providing insights into the molecular basis of AD. Additionally, 50 potential diagnostic biomarkers were discovered, offering new directions for AD diagnosis.
